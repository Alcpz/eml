Installation
============

Installation from source package
--------------------------------
From the extracted directory, run:

	./configure
	make
	make install

Installation from git
---------------------
Generate GNU Build System files first with:

	autoreconf -i

You can now proceed as with a source package:

	./configure
	make
	make install

Build configuration
-------------------
By default, the library will be built with support for all devices. If necessary
header files for a specific device type are not found on the build machine,
support will be automatically disabled for that type.

It is also possible to manually disable support for a specific device through
`configure` flags:

	--without-mic           Disable Intel Many Integrated Core support (default:
				enabled if present)
	--without-rapl          Disable Intel Running Average Power Limit support
				(default: enabled)
	--without-nvml          Disable NVIDIA Management Library support (default:
				enabled if present)

Check the output of `configure --help` for a full list of configuration
parameters.
