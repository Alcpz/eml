Installation
============

Installation from source package
--------------------------------
From the extracted directory, run:

	./configure
	make
	make install

Installation from git
---------------------
Generate GNU Build System files first with:

	autoreconf -i

You can now proceed as with a source package:

	./configure
	make
	make install

Build configuration
-------------------
By default, the library will be built with support for all devices,
except for those accessed through a network connection. If necessary
header files for a specific device type are not found on the build machine,
support will be automatically disabled for that type.

It is also possible to manually enable/disable support for a specific device through
`configure` flags:

	--with-dummy            Enable Dummy testing support (default: disabled)
	--without-mic           Disable Intel Many Integrated Core support 
	                        (default: enabled if miclib.h is available)
	--without-rapl          Disable Intel Running Average Power Limit support
	                        (default: enabled)
	--without-nvml          Disable NVIDIA Management Library support 
	                        (default: enabled if nvml.h is available)
	--with-sb-pdu           Enable Schleifenbauer PDU support (default: disabled)
	--without-odroid        Disable Odroid support (default: enabled)
	--with-labee            Enable Labee support (default: disabled)

Check the output of `./configure --help` for a full list of configuration
parameters.
